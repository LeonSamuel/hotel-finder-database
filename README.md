# Hotel Finder Database

This Hotel Database was created using Python/Flask, MYSQL, HTML, and CSS.

It is a fully functional CRUD application backed by a relational database. The application is similar to that of Kayak where users can find hotel rooms that fit their preferences while allowing employees to manage database data and database relationships. 

Users are able to do things such as add customers, edit room information, delete distributers, and filter any displayed results.
